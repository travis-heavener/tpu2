SYSCALL CODE            COMMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x00                    Prints to STDOUT the sequence of bytes starting at the memory address in BX for a length stored in CX.
0x01                    Prints to STDERR the sequence of bytes starting at the memory address in BX for a length stored in CX.
0x02                    Blocks TPU cycles and reads a sequence of bytes from STDIN to a provided memory address in BX for a length stored in CL (max of 255 chars at a time) or until a newline character is reached.
0x03                    Sets the exit status code for a program from the value stored in BX.
0x04                    Invokes the kernel dynamic heap memory allocation function, taking the desired size in CX and returning the address of allocation in DX.
0x05                    Invokes the kernel dynamic heap memory reallocation function, taking the existing heap allocation address in BX and the new desired size in CX, returning the address of allocation in DX.
0x06                    Invokes the kernel dynamic heap memory deallocation function, taking the existing heap allocation address in BX.
0x07                    Sets the addressing mode to the value in BL (0 is direct addressing, 1 is relative to the program start address stored in the first two bytes of memory).
